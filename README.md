# SQL_Excel_Tableau_Dashboard
# Covid dashboard 2020 - April 2021

This project involves executing queries on Microsoft SQL server with the help of 2 datasets taken i.e Covid_Deaths and Covid_Vaccinations, then copying the tables developed from executing queries into Microsoft Excel and then importing these tables to Tableau.

  Here, since am using Tableau Public acc, I can't directly connect to a database, so copied the tables onto Excel worksheets and then connected those worksheets to Tableau public.

# From the dashboard, we can derive the following Insights :
- World has witnessed about 2.11% of Death Percentage during the 2020 - April 2021 period.
- We can see that Europe has the most death count i.e 1016750 during the 2020 and mid of 2021, followed by North America i.e 847942.
- When we look into map, it shows that Czechia in Europe has about 16% Average Population Infected with Covid which is far more compared to its neighbour whereas United States has about ~10% Average Population infected with Covid.
- In the line chart, after  the data has been plotted till March, Tableau analysis feature has predicted
 Percent Population Infection rate till Oct 2021, we can see that Percent Population Infected has almost doubled just in span of 7 months for United States.
